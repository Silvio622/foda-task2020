For the next lines I’m using nested loops to get the dicefaces and how often they appear. I’m using for both \"for loops\" the \"range\" function. The first \"for loop\" loops through the amount of trials \"n\". The second loop loops through the dices. After the first trial \"n\" the dicesum variable will be reset to Zero and the second loop will be activated. In the second loop a random number between 1 and 6 will be created and memorized in the variable \"dice\". For the random number generation I use the numpy random randint function. Now the value from the variable \"dice\" will added together in the \"dicesum\" variable in every loop. The second loop executes until the loop reaches the last element. The amount of the loop elements depend on the \"k\" value. The \"k\" variable is the amount of dices. When the second loop has reached the last element the \"dicesum\" value will be added to the \"dicesumlist\" variable. This process will be repeated until all the elements (trials \"n\") in the first loop are executed.\n",

If characters are the same in dicesumlist as first value in the keylist (dictionary key) the values will be counted in the \"countkey\" variable. In every loop a new count value from the \"countkeys\" variable will be added to the dictionary key as a dictionary value. When all the \"dicesumlist\" elements are looped through the countkeys variable will reset to 0 and the index for the dictionary key (keyindex) will be increased by 1.
