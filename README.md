# foda-task2020
>Submit tasks to GMIT for Fundamentals of Data Analysis. The foda-task2020 contain four different tasks.

* Task 1 Python Function Count
* Task 2 Python Function Diceroll
* Task 3 Flipping a Coin
* Task 4 Simpson’s Paradox

## Task 1 Python Function Count
>A Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.
Example: the input ['A','A','B','A','C'] should have an output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1}
The code contains two code cells in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Task 2 Python Function Diceroll
>The “dicerolls” function simulates the rolling of dices. The function takes two parameters. Parameter “k” is for the amount of dices and the parameter “n” is for the amount of trails. The “dicerolls” function simulate randomly rolling “k” dice “n” times and keeping track of each total face value. The function should return a dictionary with the number of times each possible total face value occurred. Calling the function as diceroll(k=2, n=1000) should return a dictionary like: {2:19,3:50,4:82,5:112,6:135,7:174,8:133,9:114,10:75,11:70,12:36}

## Task 3 Flipping a Coin
>The Python code below simulates a flipping coin 100 or 1000 times. The amount of simulation can be changed in the variable “totaltrails” at the beginning of the python code. The python code keeps track on each coin head per simulation. The result of the simulation will be plotted in a bar plot.

## Task 4 Simpson’s Paradox
>Use Python numpy package to create four data sets. Each data set should contain an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate the Simpson's paradox.

## Explanation of how to run the jupyter notebook
The notebook can be run several ways.

* First way
#### Click on "Kernal" tab
#### Restart & Run All
